    <p>
        Have you ever had something but just can't remember where you stashed it? Well, if you start using this
        house-inventorying app, you won't need to worry about it. After spending hours of inventorying of your items
        (who knew your job at the department store would pay off) you can now have all items locations at your
        fingertips!
